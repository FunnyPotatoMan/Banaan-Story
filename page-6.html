    <p>After arriving home, the <span class="banana">banana</span> sits on the counter for a few weeks, and by this point, it's all brown and mushy though.</p>
    <p>Surely nobody will eat our poor little <span class="banana">banana</span> now, right?</p>
    <p>Actually, this was Lia's plan all along. Now that our <span class="banana">banana</span> is brown a mushy, it's perfect for...<span class="banana">banana</span> bread!</p>
